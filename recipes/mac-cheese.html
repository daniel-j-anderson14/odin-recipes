   <h2>Directions</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F</li>
    <li>Bring large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni
        in the boiling water, stirring occasionally unitl cooked through but firm
        to the bite. Drain.
    </li>
    <li>Melt butter in large pot over medium-low heat. Slowly add flour to butter,
        whisking constantly; cook until brown and the mixture no longer smells of flour.
        Pour 1 cup milk into the flour mixture, whisking continually until fully incorporated.
        Repeat this twice. Add remaining 3 cups milk to the mixture, whisking to 
        incorporate. Stir in Worcestershiresauce, mustard powder, onion powder, and cayenne 
        pepper into the mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
    </li>
    <li>Reduce heat to low. Cook sauce, whisking frequently, until it begins to thicken.
        Add about half the package of shredded Cheddar cheese; stir continually until the 
        cheese melts completely. Repeat with the remaining half package of Cheddar cheese
        and the American cheese, about 4 ounces at at time. Once cheese is entirely incorporated
        , remove sauce from heat.
    </li>
    <li>Stir drained macaroni into the cheese sauce to coat. Divide macaroni between two
        9x13 inch baking dishes.
    </li>
    <li>Mix crushed potato chips, 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, and Parmesan cheese
        in a bowl. Top the Macaroni with the potato chip mixture evenly. Spray the 
        potato chip mixture with cooking spray.
    </li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling.</li>
